# TTC-24
Rakshit bhaiya goated (allegedly )

some ground rules
write the first comment of every code telling what it does and its version name
in case of upgrading version write what the new version has which was not there in the previous version 

always write the final code as name_FIN and comment everything 
make a seperate file of it and add a readme which contains all the documentation
